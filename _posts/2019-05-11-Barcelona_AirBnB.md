This post will show examples of embedding interactive maps produced using [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium).
## Project Overview
  The project will explore the Airbnb market in Barcelona, Spain using data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). I will explore the spatial distribution of Airbnb prices and its relation to the district in which the unit located. Districtsâ€™ information includes but not limited to the concentration of restaurants, tourist attractions, and other accommodation options. The landmarks and restaurants data can be obtained from [tour-pedia.org API](http://tour-pedia.org/api/index.html).
